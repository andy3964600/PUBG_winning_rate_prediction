                     PUBG Finish Placement Prediction


   Motivation:   What's the best strategy to win in PUBG? 
               Should you sit in one spot and hide your way into victory, or do you need to be the top shot? 
               
   Purpose:    In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). 
             Players can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. 
             In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, 
             and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.
             You are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. 
             The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.
